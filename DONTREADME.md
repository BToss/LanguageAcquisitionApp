# These are the equations for converting native speaker vowel coordinates to target areas on the xy graph:
# Center of mass:  (∑x^2)/N and (∑y^2) where x and y are the corresponding coordinates and N is the number of points being looked at.
# Radius of the target: (∑2xdx)/N and (∑2ydy)/N where x and y are the corresponding coordinates, N is the number of points, and dx and dy are the error inherent in the calculation
# Bark Difference coefficient Error: dzi = (((Fi+1960)26.81-26.81)200)/(Fi+1960)^2 where dzi is the error of the Z score for Fi, and where Fi is Formant i
# Coordinate error: dx = √(dz3)^2 + (dz2)^2 and dy = √(dz3)^2 + (dz1)^2
