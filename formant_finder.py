#Step 1 Person produces vowel as input and is passed into Kiss FFT

#Step 2 is utilizing the c library Kiss FFT
#go here to get it: https://github.com/itdaniher/kissfft

#TODO: step 4(Bark Difference Metric): Normalizes the vowel formants so different speakers register the same vowels
#zi = (26.81/((1+1960)/Fi))-0.53 aaaaaannnnnd then the output of that, the x axis is z3-z2  and y axis is z3-z1
#Step 5 is plotting matrix on graph utilizing above
#Step 6 is synthesizing exemplar vowel measurements into "target areas" on graph (See Archetype Calculations)
